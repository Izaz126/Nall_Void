Design & Methodology
Design: 
The design of the game "Null Void" was carefully crafted to create an
immersive and thrilling experience for players. The game's world was
created with a winter atmosphere, providing players with a unique 
and visually stunning environment to explore. The character in the 
game is a custom-designed 3D third-person character, developed by 
the team member Shakil Anower Samrat, which adds a unique 
element to the game's world.
One of the key elements of the game's design is the inclusion of a 
pipe that moves round and round, and if it hits the character, the 
character will die, providing an added challenge for players. This 
feature is designed to test the player's skill and dexterity, as well as 
add an element of danger to the game.
The game's user interface was designed to be simple and easy to 
navigate, with clear and concise instructions. The win screen, death 
screen, pause screen, and main menu were all designed to be 
visually appealing and easy to understand, allowing players to quickly
navigate through the game. The game's UI design is minimalistic and 
user-friendly, making it easy for players to understand the controls 
and navigate the game.

This way we have designed the game. Now let’s move on to the 
methodology part.
Methodology: 
Conceptualization: The team began by conceptualizing the game, 
discussing ideas for the game's storyline, gameplay mechanics, and 
visual design. The team also researched similar games and identified 
what features they wanted to include in "Null Void" and what 
features they wanted to avoid.
Development: Once the concept was finalized, the team began the 
development process. This included creating the game's world, 
designing and implementing the game's mechanics, and developing 
the game's visual design. The team used Unreal Engine 5 as the game
engine, Blueprint as the visual scripting system, and C++ for 
programming.
